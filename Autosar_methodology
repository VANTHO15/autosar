Creating an AUTOSAR Software Component (SWC) in Vector DaVinci Developer and DaVinci Configurator involves a structured process. 
1. Create an AUTOSAR Software Component in DaVinci Developer
Vector DaVinci Developer is used to define Software Components (SWCs), interfaces, and their internal behavior.
Step 1: Create a New Project
Open Vector DaVinci Developer.
Select File → New Project.
Choose a name for your project and specify the AUTOSAR version (e.g., AUTOSAR 4.2, 4.3, 4.4).
Select the Template Type:
Standard Application SWC
Service SWC
Sensor/Actuator SWC
Click Finish to create the project.
Step 2: Define the SWC
Right-click on the project workspace and select New → Software Component.
Enter the Component Name (e.g., MyAppSWC).
Choose Component Type:
Application SWC
Service SWC
Complex Device Driver (CDD)
Click OK to create the component.
Step 3: Create Ports and Interfaces
Open the SWC Editor.
Navigate to the Ports & Interfaces tab.
Add Ports:Click New Provide Port (P-Port) to create a service/data provider.
Click New Require Port (R-Port) to request services/data.
Assign the Interface Type:
Sender-Receiver (S/R) – For exchanging signals.
Client-Server (C/S) – For function calls.
Mode Switch – To switch operational modes.
Define Data Elements (for S/R interfaces) or Operations (for C/S interfaces).
Step 4: Define Runnables and Events
Go to the Internal Behavior section.
Create a new Runnable Entity (Right-click → New Runnable).
Assign an Entry Point Function for the runnable (e.g., Runnable_1).
Map Events to Runnables:
Timing Event – Executes periodically.
Data Received Event – Triggers on new data.
Operation Invoked Event – Triggers on function call.
Define the Execution Time and Scheduling constraints.
Step 5: Generate ARXML for SWC
Click File → Export → AUTOSAR XML (.arxml).
Choose the Destination Folder for saving the file.
Click Export.
The tool generates an .arxml file containing SWC configurations.
2. Configure SWC in DaVinci Configurator
Vector DaVinci Configurator is used to configure the Basic Software (BSW) Modules and integrate the SWC into the ECU.
Step 1: Import the SWC into DaVinci Configurator
Open DaVinci Configurator.
Click File → New Project.
Select ECU Configuration template.
Import the SWC ARXML from DaVinci Developer:
Click Import AUTOSAR XML.
Select the SWC .arxml file.
Click OK.
Step 2: Configure the RTE (Runtime Environment)
Navigate to the RTE Configuration tab.
Assign the SWC to the ECU instance.
Map SWC Ports to BSW Modules (e.g., COM, NVM).
Configure Memory Mapping for SWC variables.
Step 3: Generate the RTE and BSW Code
Click Generate Code to create:
RTE Code for SWC integration.
BSW Configuration Files.
The tool will generate C code for AUTOSAR RTE and BSW.
Step 4: Compile and Integrate
Import the generated RTE and BSW code into your AUTOSAR project.
Compile the software using a compiler like GCC or TASKING.
Load the compiled software onto the ECU and validate.
